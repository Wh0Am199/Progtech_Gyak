### System Plan

### Computer configurer. Can pick the parts in a form that you want, compatibility will be checked, for example an LGA 1155 socket processor can only fit in the same socket motherboard, or a motherboard can handle DDR4 and DDR3 RAM or only DDR3. The GPU requires a 700W PSU or only a 400W.

### Methods planned to use: Singleton: For a container class that will be created only once for collecting the computers.	Decorator: I'm going to put the parts in a case, because also a laptop and a desktop has a case that covers the parts' of the pc. Used Strategy Method for different types of motherboards. Planning to use Prototype if similar parts should be copied e.g: cpu
